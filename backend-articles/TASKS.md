#1. Writing

#### 1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but we’d love to know why you’re proud of it.
#### 2. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it as well.

# 2. Coding

When working in the field of national media, you often come across concepts like article, authors, assets and users.
We provided you a minimal Spring Boot application (as it is generated by start.spring.io) with **Java11** and build with **Maven**.
As you are familiar with reactive programming, we decided to use this flavour to define the initial App. If you do not like to work with the reactive stack,
feel free to switch back to regular Spring MVC.

The App currently provides an endpoint to *list all* and or *get a single* `NewsArticle` by its id.

Your task is to extend this App to be a minimal viable product for publishing news articles. 

Make sure that your software works as expected by writing tests, where you think it is necessary.
We don't expect you to reach an 80% code coverage. You will need to use your time wisely.

## Familiarize with the project and build the basis
#### 1. Create sufficient package structure

The classes in this artifact are all in one package called `de.futurecompany`. Create a reasonable package structure and move the classes to where they belong.

#### 2. Implement a controller to create new `NewsArticle`s

Please extend the application with the functionality to create a new Article using REST principles.

#### 3. Introduce persistence for Article

Make the domain object `NewsArticle` persistent, either on a local `mysqld` or a local `mongodb`.

#### 4. Allow publishing of an `NewsArticle`

Our readers will want to read these new articles.

Therefore, authors needs to be able to mark an article as published in order to allow users to read them. 
Published articles must be distinguished by a "published" flag, and a publication timestamp.

## Introduce new feature: Images
#### 5. Allow adding Images to an article

Our readers will like our articles even more, when they have images added to them. Introduce this feature to our `NewsArticle`s.
An image is described by `{ url: string, caption: string, imageAuthor: string, price: int}`. Here is the list of user stories to be implemented.

* as an author I want to add images in order to use them later in my articles.
* as an author I want to reference an added image to an existing article in order to make articles more interesting.
* as an author I want to use the same image on different articles in order to save costs.

#### 6. Add Validation: disallow adding same Image (based on image name) to an Article twice

Showing the same image on an article twice is not desired. Add validation logic to prohibit this.
It is expected that the API will return a reasonable response (StatusCode, ErrorDetails).

## Introduce new domain "Accounting"

Now that an article with many images can be published, we need to pay royalties to the image-author.
We call this new feature "Accounting". Please introduce this new concept to our domain.

To give you some hints about this new concept:
* An image becomes "accountable" when an Article is published
* An image is identified by its `url`.
* If an image was already published as part of another article, we don't need to consider it again
* once we paid for the image we are allowed to use it as many times as we want

#### 7. Implement an accounting endpoint to list all image-authors with published images

This list could be later used to generate a report or display it in a fancy backoffice.

#### 8. Add logic to calculate the total image price sum by its `image-author`

The price-calculation is a real critical part of our application, as we neither want to pay too much, nor to few royalties to the image-authors. 
Show us that the calculation works.

### 9. Extend the accounting endpoint to show for each image-author the calculated total price sum

## Towards production

### 10. Change build process to create an executable JAR file and add run documentation

We want to be able to start our App by running simple `java -jar ....` command. Change our build to create an executable jar.

Add a detailed explanation how to start the App locally into `RUN.md`.

### 11. Describe your next steps towards deploying your app to production

Now that you've mastered to implement all new features, the next step is to deploy the feature to production. Write down some ideas
what is missing to run this app on a production environment. Also consider that your app will be used by multiple editors at the same time.
